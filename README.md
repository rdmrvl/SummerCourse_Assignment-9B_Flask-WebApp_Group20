For this assignment on waste generation data sourced from each district/city across Indonesia between 2018 and 2023, each group selected data from two different provinces. The data was analyzed to address the following objectives:

Calculate the total annual waste generation for each province in each year to understand yearly trends.
Determine the average total annual waste generation per province over the entire period to identify long-term patterns.
Identify which province produced the most and least waste annually each year to highlight regional variations.
Create graphs depicting the total annual waste generation trends per province over the years to visualize trends effectively.
Provide categorization and visualization of average annual waste incidence per province:
Provinces categorized as "GREEN" if average annual waste generation is 100,000 tons or less.
Provinces categorized as "ORANGE" if average annual waste generation is between 100,000 and 700,000 tons.
Provinces categorized as "RED" if average annual waste generation is over 700,000 tons.
Develop a Flask-based web application to offer interactive visualizations of both total annual waste trends and categorized average annual waste generation for each province throughout the specified period.
